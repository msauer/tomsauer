Edikon Release 0.7 of PHPShop

Using Authorize.net with phpShop

Authorize.net integration was added in version 0.7.0 of phpshop
using Authorize.Net's Advanced Integration Method (AIM) using 
OpenSSL and sockets to send and receive information securely.
Read Authorize.Net implementation guides to better understand 
how to implement it.

Requirements:
- PHP 4.3.0 or later, compiled with OpenSSL support.

  NOTE: There was a bug in Windows PHP with using fsockopen() in 
        SSL mode. A patch is offered at:
        http://ftp.proventum.net/pub/php/win32/misc/openssl/
        (use at your own risk)

Installation:
1. In the phpshop.cfg file you need to set 4 variables:
   AN_ENABLE, AN_LOGIN, AN_TRAN_KEY, AN_TYPE, AN_TEST_REQUEST

   - AN explanation and an example of each is provided in the 
     phpshop.cfg file.

2. You must also enable each "Payment Method" to be used with authorization
   methods (ie. Authorize.net). This is done in the Administration area of
   phpshop:
     - In "Store", choose "List Payment Methods"
     - Make sure that the desired Payment Methods have a "Y" for "Authorize".

This should enable Authorize.Net

Advanced Settings:
------------------
Authorize.Net has many configurations. You can set all these in:
./modules/checkout/lib/ps_checkout.inc
on the authnet_process() function.
(Careful editing this file. Make sure you understand what you are
doing)
