!!! Fixes and Other
* Fixed style sheet formatting and page layout for demo store and admin area.  Looks much more pleasing to the eye.
* Created new folder structure in htdocs for images/, styles/ and javascript/.  shop images (a.k.a. shop_image) are now under images/shop/.  This means you need to change your store info to point to the new image path.
* Change the way we generate menus in the admin area by using a slidemenu.

* Added Lost Password Recovery.   Thanks to Brett O'Donnell
* Added pretty category names.  This makes search engine friendly links to categories.  Thanks to JohnS!
* Added CSV product import capabilities.  Now products can be put into a CSV file and imported directly via the administration interface.  Thanks to John Syben
* Added SMTP class for sending email.  Can be easily configured via the config. This is good news for when running on windows.  Updated all places that send email to use this class.  SMTP mail is optional.  Set in config.php

  clients.
- Fixed email validation routine to allow uppercase and lowercase letters.

July 13, 2000 (0.4.5)
- Removed the use of PHPLIB from phpShop. Since mySQL is currently the only 
  supported database, we simply wrote a database access class that is
  heavily based on PHPLIB by using the same method names, etc.  This ensures
  backwards compatibility with existing stores.  The new database class was 
  placed in the /db directory.
- Fixed list_attribute() function bugs that would print attributes repeatedly.
- Fixed demo store links that pointed to incorrect module for shipping address
  updates.
- Renamed to payment_method table to order_payment.
- Added new payment_method table to database for use with the Payment Methods Module.

  dynamically.  Each payment method can be given a discount rate (+/-) and also be 
  selected for Cybercash processing.
- Added Cybercash Payment Processing capability for Cybercash 3.0 or above.  
- Credit Card account numbers are stored in encypted form in the database using
  mySQL's ENCODE and DECODE functions.  The hash key can be set in the phpshop.cfg 
  file using the ENCODE_KEY directive.
- Added payment processing log to admin's order display using the order_payment 
  table to log the Cybercash or simple capture of data processing.


June 30, 2000 (0.4.2)
- Fixed login bugs.  This makes it necessary to build the login/registration
  as shown in the shop/html/login.ihtml page.  Old login pages will need to be
  updated.
- Changed the way phpShop generates the product and vendor images.  Added the 
  show_image() function to the ps_product and ps_vendor classes.  The show_iamge()
  function now takes two arguments.  The name of the image file to show, and any
  arguments that want to be sent along to the IMG tag.  The old show_image() 
  function in ps_main.inc has been removed.
- The get_price function was deleted from ps_main.inc and moved to the ps_product
  class.
- The list_attribute() function has been moved from ps_main.inc to the
  ps_product_attribute class.  It has also been updated to accept one argument. 
  The product_id is sent and the list_attribute function draws a drop down list
  containing the attribute list.  It is dynamic and can handle a variable number
  of attributes.  
- The location of the shop_images has been moved to be relative to the URL paths. 
  That is, images will be resolved by first prepending the URL or
  http://www.phpshop.org/demo/
  Then the vendor_image path is used:
  http://www.phpshop.org/demo/shop_images/
  Then if it is a product or vendor...
  http://www.phpshop.org/demo/shop_images/product/
  Then the image name
  http://www.phpshop.org/demo/shop_images/product/image_name.gif
  Image generation will check for SSL and create the path accordingly.
- File upload now handles PNG files.
- Cart does not accept fractional quantities.
- VERSION.txt moved to DOCROOT directory.

- New perm class for permission checking.

  at the new store to understand the changes made.  Some important
  information found in these classes:

  $auth["last_name"]
