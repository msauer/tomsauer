!!Step 1. 
Make sure you have PHP 4.3.4 or higher
a.  Make sure that magic_quotes_gpc is ENABLED.  This can be done by editing the php.ini file. For more information on how to do this, please refer to the PHP manual.

!!Step 2.
Make sure you are running MySQL 3.23 or higher.

!!Step 3.
Uncompress the phpshop distribution anywhere inside your web tree.

!!Step 4. 
Now we have to create the phpShop database. You will need a MySQL user with sufficient permissions to do this. If you use a HOSTING server, you might have to use the tools they provide (ie. phpMyAdmin). You might also need to add the user and password options to the commands (-u <user> -p<password>) in the following examples, which use the command line programs usually provided in MySQL distributions.

   a. Create a database on MySQL:

   EXAMPLE:
   mysqladmin create phpshop

   b. We need to make sure we have a user with SELECT, INSERT
   UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, and DROP privileges:

   EXAMPLE:

   $ mysql -e "GRANT select, insert, update, create, alter, delete, drop
   ON phpshop TO dbuser@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'dbpass'" phpshop
   $ mysqladmin reload

   where you replace the relevant information (i.e. phpshop (db name),
   dbuser, and dbpass).


   c. We then import the tables and data from the phpShop distribution. This
   includes the demo data. The file is found at ./db/phpshop.sql

   EXAMPLE:
   mysql -u dbuser -p dbpass -h localhost phpshop < ./db/phpshop.sql

If you use a hosting service, they may provide tools that automate much of the process described above.  Simply create the phpshop database and import the SQL file.

!!Step 5. 
Next we need to setup the WEB-INF/etc/config.php.  This is the main configuration file for the phpShop system. First off, we need to rename the etc/config-dist.php to etc/config.php.

Then edit etc/config.php.  You will need to edit the following entries: URL, SECUREURL, DB_HOST, DB_NAME, DB_USER, DB_PWD

   EXAMPLE:
     define("URL","http://your.site.org/demo/");
     define("SECUREURL","http://your.site.org/demo/");
     define("DB_HOST","localhost");
     define("DB_NAME","phpshop");
     define("DB_USER","dbuser");
     define("DB_PWD","dbpass");

    ** NOTE: If you do not have a secure server, you still must set the
       SECUREURL variable.  You can simply set it to be the same
       as the URL variable.  If you have a secure server then use the
       url to your secure sever (i.e. https://your.site.org/demo/).

You'll see a bunch of other stuff, but this will get you going for now. You can play with the rest later.  Beware of the beginning and ending slashes on the directory names.

!!Step 6. 
Open your web browser and go to the directory where you installed the index.php file:

   EXAMPLE:
     http://your.site.org/demo

You should see the demo store.

To get into the administration area, login as:

   username:  admin
   password:  test

In the administrative area, go the the phpShop Administrator and immediately change the admin's password to something else.

NOTE:  The following users are preinstalled in the phpShop distribution:

      UID            PWD       PERMS
      -------------- --------- ----------
      test           test      shopper
      storeadmin     test      storeadmin
      demo           demo      demo
      admin          test      admin

You should remove these users or reset their passwords before going live.

Study the demo store. Study both the shop and the way it is set up in the administrative area and you should be off to a good start!

Create your own store by editing "Washupito's Tiendita".

Let us know if anything goes wrong.  phpShop has quite a few lines of code which makes debugging a real... pleasant experience.  But we would not be able to enjoy the peace and tranquility of a soothing summer afternoon sitting - debugging, without your help.

Please report bugs at the phpShop.org website, http://www.phpshop.org/ under "Bugs". Please make sure you specify the version number, operating system and PHP version in use.
