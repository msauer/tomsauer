CYBERCASH and phpShop

* We are deprecating support for Cybercash as the payment gateway is no 
longer used by Verisign.

phpShop offers integration with the Cybercash CashRegister software.
In order to use Cybercash with phpShop (or with PHP for that matter) you
need to recompile your PHP intepreter with the cybercash extensions
provided by the PHP team.  The extensions are in the ext/cyberlib directory 
under your source distribution of PHP.   
                
In order to set up PHP for this, do the following:

1.  Setup a cybercash account or get a demo account where they
    will provide you with a Merchant ID.  

2.  Download the Cybercask MCK for your OS type.  Install the C API by 
    following the MCK installation instructions.

3.  Setup your PHP source by running the configure script with your
    regular setup options and add:
  
                      --with-cybercash=[DIR]
    
    if using PHP 3.x it will be

		      --with-mck=[DIR]

    where [DIR] is the path to the MCK C API files.    

4.  In the phpshop.cfg file you need to set 4 variables.  They are:

    CC_MERCHANT            => This is your Cybercash ID.
    CC_MERCHANT_KEY"       => Your Cybercash Secret Merchant Key
    CC_PAYMENT_URL"        => The Cybercash Payment URL
    CC_AUTH_TYPE"          => The authentication type preceded by the 
			      letter 'm' (e.g. mauthonly)

    These fields are given to you immediately by Cybercash.  It's actually quite 
    simple

5.  The payment methods listed in the Store Administrator allow you to select which 
    payment methods Cybercash is setup to handle. Select the cards you want to support
    and enable the Cybercash processing by selecting it and saving the changes.

You are now setup to handle Cybercash!


The Cybercash transaction log is appended to each Order in the Order Administrator.
